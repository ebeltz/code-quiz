# Code Quiz

## Quiz
To make this password generator work, I had to insert all possible letters in both uppercase and lowercase format, add what numbers could be used, and I had to make sure that the correct special characters were included as well. I then had to create the function to generate the password conditions. After the function for the password conditions, I had to create a function to actually generate the final password based on the user's input.
